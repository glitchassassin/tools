This app is built with React Router 7 on Cloudflare Workers.

## Feature Development

Follow this to-do list for every feature:

1. Write concise and thorough human-readable test scenarios to docs/tests/{feature}.md, and have the user review
2. Implement the feature
3. Write e2e tests that follow the defined test scenarios, include Axe accessibility checking for any new pages

## End-to-End Tests

The app uses Playwright for e2e tests. When implementing a feature, write concise e2e tests that check the feature's acceptance criteria. Prefer to combine tests that cover the same path through the app. Write tests that cover the feature's "happy path" as well as error scenarios.

## Components

Wherever it makes sense, extract reusable components into app/components. This helps us standardize functionality as well as the look & feel of the app.
