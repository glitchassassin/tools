# Implementation Plan

Tackle these tasks, one at a time, and check them off when complete. Make sure
that each acceptance criteria has a test, or ask the user to update the task if
some of the criteria aren't testable.

[Break down the implementation into phases. Each phase should run and be
testable, be large enough to be a meaningful chunk of work, but no more than 3-7
discrete tasks]
