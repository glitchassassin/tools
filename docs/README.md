# Documentation Driven Development

The future of AI productivity is _delegation_. We will write apps in English -
defining the features, requirements, acceptance criteria - and encode rules that
define our preferred development patterns.

Then, from those seeds, a code agent can grow something cool.

## Usage

Fill out the PRD template (feel free to use AI!). Once you are happy with the
level of detail, break it down into implementation phases (might be best to
split this into multiple files, depending on size and detail).

Then, let the agents work on each task, create a PR, review the changes, and
iterate if needed.
